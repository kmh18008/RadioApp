- The Radio app has 5 radio stations (taken from the internet) on one screen.
- Audio works in its own thread way so the radio station keeps working and does not get hung up on the UI thread.
- Volume control is also incorporated.

- Can properly shut on and off the radio stations as new radio stations are selected using:
    + "Sing" (start)
    + "Pause" (Stop/Pause)
